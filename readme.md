`$ npm install`
`$ npm start`

Open browser and visit something like,

`http://localhost:3000/?message=[The Message]&number=[The Number]&subject=[The Subject]`

The mobile number should be E.164 format but without the + character.

eg, 

You want to send a message to a number,

The country code is 44

The mobile number is (0)7700 900123

The E.164 format would be +447700900123

Remove the + character
